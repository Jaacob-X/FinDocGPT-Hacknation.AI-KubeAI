# Frontend Integration Complete

## ðŸŽ‰ Successfully Integrated the Interactive Pipeline

The FinDocGPT frontend has been completely restructured to integrate the data fetch, store, and query pipeline from the interactive script into a modern web interface.

## âœ… What's Been Implemented

### 1. **New User Flow**
- **Company Input First**: Users start by entering a company name or ticker
- **Company-Specific Page**: Navigate to `/company/[company_name]` for dedicated analysis
- **Document Management**: View, fetch, and manage SEC documents for the company
- **Query Interface**: Ask company-specific questions with RAG-powered responses

### 2. **Real API Integration**
- **No Mock Data**: Removed all mock/placeholder data from the frontend
- **Live Edgar Integration**: Real SEC document fetching via EdgarTools
- **Cognee RAG**: Actual document storage and querying using Cognee service
- **Real-time Status**: Live document processing status updates

### 3. **Backend Enhancements**
- **New Endpoint**: `POST /api/documents/query_company_documents/` for company-specific queries
- **Company Filtering**: Enhanced document filtering by company name
- **Integrated Pipeline**: Full fetch â†’ store â†’ query workflow in the backend

### 4. **Frontend Architecture**
- **Clean Structure**: Removed old components (QueryInterface, StrategyView, DocumentList)
- **Modern UI**: New company selection page with suggested companies
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status updates during document processing

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### 1. Start the Application
```bash
# Backend
cd backend/
python manage.py runserver

# Frontend  
cd frontend/
npm run dev
```

### 2. User Journey
1. **Home Page**: Enter a company name (e.g., "Apple Inc", "AAPL")
2. **Company Page**: Automatically fetches SEC documents if none exist
3. **Document Tab**: View fetched documents, their processing status, fetch more
4. **Query Tab**: Ask questions about the company using stored documents

### 3. Example Queries
- "What was the revenue growth in the last quarter?"
- "What are the main risk factors for this company?"
- "How much cash does the company have?"
- "What are the key business segments?"
