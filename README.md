- Filter documents based on company criteria (if specified)
- Prepare structured context for analysis

#### 2. **Initial Analysis Generation**
- Generate comprehensive investment analysis using OpenAI GPT-4
- Base analysis on document summaries and available metadata
- Structure results with investment recommendation, reasoning, and risk factors

#### 3. **Completeness Evaluation**
- AI-powered assessment of analysis quality and completeness
- Identify specific gaps, weaknesses, and missing information
- Generate completeness score (0-10 scale)
- Determine if analysis meets quality threshold (‚â•7/10)

#### 4. **Targeted RAG Query Generation**
- Generate specific queries to address identified gaps
- Focus on missing financial data, market context, or risk factors
- Create targeted questions for the RAG knowledge base

#### 5. **RAG Query Execution with Validation**
- Execute queries against Cognee knowledge graph
- **Gemini Validation Layer**: Assess if RAG responses adequately answer queries
- **Fallback Enhancement**: Use Gemini internet search if RAG responses are insufficient
- **Source Attribution**: Track whether information comes from documents or web search

#### 6. **Analysis Refinement**
- Integrate RAG results into the original analysis
- Update recommendations based on new information
- Enhance reasoning with additional context and data
- Mark sections that have been significantly updated

#### 7. **Iteration Control**
- Repeat steps 3-6 until analysis reaches quality threshold or max iterations (10)
- Real-time progress tracking with cancellation support
- Preserve partial results if process is terminated early

### Key Innovations

- **Self-Improving**: Each iteration builds upon previous analysis
- **Gap-Driven**: Focuses refinement on specific identified weaknesses
